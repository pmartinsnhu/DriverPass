# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is intended to provide new drivers with resources and in-person instruction while studying for their DMV license test. 
They asked me to design a system available to anyone with an internet connection with varying degrees of paid subscription.

What did you do particularly well?

In my opinion, my does an excellent job of covering all bases as far as business requirements are concerned. I have read through the transcript of the 
conversation with DriverPass several times and I don't think there is anything I missed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could focus on one area of improvement, I believe it would be the UML use case diagram. I did not account for MFA when making the diagram despite it being a large 
piece of DriverPass's security.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Luckily we had a transcipt of the a conversation we had with DriverPass about what their needs would be. It is important not only to have this conversation in person
but also to keep a transcript of what was said in order to revisit the conversation whenever necessary.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In the future I will continue to write out a piece of softwares requirements before making an design decisions. I think once everything has been hashed out as a high level,  
you can begin to make more technical decisions about how to incorporate everything.
